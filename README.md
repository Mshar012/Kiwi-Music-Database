## Project: Kiwi Music Database

### Overview

This project was developed as part of the IS 455 (Database Design and Prototyping) course at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Kiwi Music is a fictional startup designed to explore database design principles in a real-world scenario. The project focuses on music discovery, storage, and sharing, supporting independent artists in managing their profiles, uploading tracks, and engaging with fans. It also provides music lovers with tools to curate playlists and discover new music.
